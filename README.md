# TestAddonAceConfig

A sample addon to demonstrate how to use [AceConfig](http://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/pages/api/ace-config-3-0/) and [AceDB](http://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/pages/ace-db-3-0-tutorial/) to set and save options in your World of Warcraft Addon.

Following [http://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/pages/getting-started/](http://www.wowace.com/addons/ace3/pages/getting-started/) was very unclear to me so I thought doing this up would help me work things through, and it did.

A working sample addon.
